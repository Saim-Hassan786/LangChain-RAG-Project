# LangChain Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Project

This project explores **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** using **LangChain**, a powerful framework for developing language model applications. RAG enhances the capabilities of language models by allowing them to retrieve relevant, real-world information from external data sources and integrate that into generated responses.

## 📚 What is RAG?

**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a method that combines:

- **Retrieval**: Fetching relevant documents or text chunks from a knowledge base.
- **Generation**: Using a large language model (LLM) to synthesize an answer from the retrieved content.

This hybrid approach helps models:
- Stay **factual** and **grounded** in real data.
- Avoid hallucination (making things up).
- Work with **custom knowledge** not present in the model’s training data.

## 🧠 Why Use RAG?

Standard LLMs, like GPT-4 or Claude, are powerful but have limitations:
- They are trained only on fixed data (up to a cutoff date).
- They may not know about private or custom datasets.

**RAG solves this** by letting the model access **dynamic, domain-specific, or up-to-date information** at inference time.

## 🛠️ LangChain’s Role

**LangChain** simplifies building RAG pipelines by:
- Providing abstractions for **retrievers**, **vector stores**, and **LLMs**.
- Supporting document loading, text splitting, embedding, and indexing.
- Enabling chains and agents to orchestrate complex workflows.

Your project uses LangChain to:
1. **Load and process documents** (PDFs, text files, etc.).
2. **Split text into chunks** for better retrieval.
3. **Embed and store chunks** in a vector database (e.g., FAISS).
4. **Use retrievers** to fetch relevant content based on user queries.
5. **Generate responses** using a connected LLM (like OpenAI or HuggingFace).

## 🔍 Workflow Overview

1. **Document Ingestion**: Uploads and reads source data.
2. **Chunking & Embedding**: Breaks documents into meaningful chunks and embeds them using vector representations.
3. **Storage**: Saves embeddings in a vector database.
4. **Retrieval**: Finds the most relevant chunks based on user input.
5. **Generation**: Sends the query + retrieved context to the LLM to produce a grounded answer.

## 💡 Key Theoretical Concepts

- **Vector Similarity Search**: Used to find text chunks semantically similar to the query.
- **Prompt Engineering**: How you present the retrieved context to the LLM affects response quality.
- **Context Windows**: LLMs have limited token windows; RAG helps optimize what to include.
- **Evaluation**: RAG output should be evaluated for relevance, accuracy, and completeness.

## 📦 Tools & Libraries Used

- **LangChain**: Framework for building LLM-powered applications.
- **FAISS / Chroma**: Vector stores for fast similarity search.
- **OpenAI / HuggingFace**: Backend LLMs used for generation.
- **PyPDF / Unstructured**: For reading and parsing documents.

It walks through:
- Installing dependencies
- Loading documents
- Creating a retriever
- Asking questions and generating answers

## 📈 Benefits of This RAG Approach

- Tailored answers using your data
- Reduces hallucinations
- Updates without retraining the model
- Scalable and customizable for many domains (legal, medical, finance, etc.)

---

## 🧪 Future Improvements

- Add feedback loops for fine-tuning retriever accuracy
- Use advanced retrievers like BM25 hybrid models
- Integrate UI for user input/output
- Add evaluation metrics (e.g., exact match, F1, ROUGE)
